# Ornamission - HackCamp 2024

# Problem to be Solved

As the holiday season approaches, we face a long-standing issue: overconsumption. It not only creates financial strain but also contributes to environmental harm, with countless unnecessary purchases ending up in landfills. Many of us already have everything we need, while others lack essential support. In a time of rising environmental challenges and global instability, the world could truly benefit from a little extra help and kindness. This is where Ornamission comes in.

# Purpose

Ornamission offers a meaningful alternative to traditional gift-giving by allowing users to donate to charitable causes instead. Users can decorate a virtual holiday tree with ornaments, each representing a different charity or cause. Every ornament unlocks a unique animation or a thank-you message from the charity, making the experience interactive and enjoyable. Once complete, users can share their personalized tree with friends and family as a digital gift, adding a visual and gamified element that makes giving more engaging and fun.

This is a collaborative project submitted for the nwPlus HackCamp 2024 hackathon.
